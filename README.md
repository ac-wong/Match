# Match

The purpose of this project is to create a simple matching game. Players need to find all matching pairs of cards on the deck.

## Instructions

### Start the game

Open the **index.html** file using the latest version of **Chrome** web browser. The game starts automatically when the page has finished loading.

### How to play

There are eight pairs of cards to match in each game. To win a game, you need to find all matching pairs.

You need to turn over two cards at a time. If the two cards match, they turn green and remain face up. If the two cards don't match, they turn red before becoming face down.

### Scores

During play, the following information is displayed:

* **Star rating**: A new game starts with three stars, and the number of stars reduces as the number of moves increases.
* **Time**: A timer shows the time taken (mm:ss).
* **Moves**: The number of incorrect moves taken is displayed.

### Restart the game

You can start a new game at any time by clicking the **restart** button.

A **Play Again** link is displayed on the modal after winning the game. Click this link to play a new game.

### Exit the game

To exit the game, simply close the web browser.
